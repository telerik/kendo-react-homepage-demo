component scrolls to the top, selecting/focusing the first element. Even if a data item has selected:true, this still happens on the first focus. Note. it happens only on the first focus.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nOn focus, initial or subsequent, the scroll position should not get affected and the item clicked, should get focused/selected, not the first item in the data list.\r\n\r\n## Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions\r\nTo reproduce, simply go to any example, like this one:\r\nhttps://twj8am.run.stackblitz.io\r\n(which was taken from here)\r\nhttps://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/treeview/\r\nthen, resize the browser window height to be small enough so that a vertical scrollbar appears.\r\nscroll down to the last treeView item and then click it.\r\n\r\n## What is the motivation or use case for changing the behavior?\r\nany scenario where there are more data items than can fit into the view, cause this on initial click/focus... it requires the user to click twice just to select one item.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nlatest chrome browser\r\n\r\nPackage versions:\r\n\x3c!--\r\n  Paste the output from "npm ls --depth 0" in the code block below.\r\n  Omit this step if the problem is reproducible on our demo site.\r\n--\x3e\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBrowser:\r\n- Chrome (desktop) version 72\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n- Platform:  Mac\r\n\r\n',createdAt:"2019-02-12T18:23:44Z",author:{login:"antoniosZil",avatarUrl:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18335882?v=4"},assignees:{nodes:[{name:"Asen Arizanov",avatarUrl:"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24224244?v=4"}]},url:"https://github.com/telerik/kendo-react/issues/190",labels:{edges:[{node:{name:"bug",color:"ee0701"}},{node:{name:"pkg:treeview",color:"fef2c0"}}]}}},{node:{title:"Grid filter row is not locked.",state:"CLOSED",number:191,body:"Grid filter row is not locked.\r\n\r\nIf the Grid has locked columns the filter row is not locked:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-wrurgl?file=app%2Fmain.js",createdAt:"2019-02-18T07:32:26Z",author:{login:"simonssspirit",avatarUrl:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11087921?v=4"},assignees:{nodes:[{name:"Vasil Raev",avatarUrl:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9458606?v=4"}]},url:"https://github.com/telerik/kendo-react/issues/191",labels:{edges:[{node:{name:"bug",color:"ee0701"}},{node:{name:"pkg:grid",color:"fef2c0"}}]}}},{node:{title:"Portals are not currently supported error appears when setting MultiSelect opened property inside Popup",state:"OPEN",number:192,body:'\x3c!--\r\n  Please help us process GitHub issues faster by providing the necessary information in the template format that follows.\r\n  We might not be able to assist with issues which lack important information.\r\n--\x3e\r\n\r\n## I\'m submitting a bug\r\n\x3c!--\r\n  Please submit:\r\n  * Feature requests to our UserVoice Portal at https://goo.gl/HsVr7R.\r\n  * Support requests to https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets.\r\n--\x3e\r\n\r\n\x3c!--  Leave one of the following options. --\x3e\r\n* Bug report \x3c!-- Please search for a similar issue before you submit a bug report. --\x3e\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\nWhen rendering a Popup component which contains a child MutiSelect component with the opened prop set to true, the page crashes. displaying : Error in /turbo_modules/react-dom@16.8.2/cjs/react-dom-server.browser.development.js (53:15)\r\nPortals are not currently supported by the server renderer.

I want to handle some logic only when something is `inProgress` if it's not in progress no state changes should happen.\r\nBut when this actual thing is indeed `inProgress` (has a `true` value) in `render` scope it's actually `true` while in callback it somehow appears to be still `false`.\r\n\r\nI watched the code of `useClickOutside` and there is no `useCallback` involved to cause such issue, so I assume it can be some issue with React itself.\r\n\r\nI also opened an issue in the repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/sandiiarov/use-events/issues/35\r\n\r\nPlease check its source code here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sandiiarov/use-events/blob/master/src/useClickOutside/index.tsx",createdAt:"2019-02-22T21:57:31Z",author:{login:"RIP21",avatarUrl:"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3940079?v=4"},assignees:{nodes:[]},url:"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14932",labels:{edges:[]}}},{node:{title:"Add support for functions as children in Suspense",state:"CLOSED",number:14933,body:'**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n`<Suspense children={() => {}} />` is not supported.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nAs mentioned [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13947#issuecomment-465743800) before, I hope that there will be support for `children` to be a render prop in `<Suspense />`. Why? I currently have the following case where I dislike to define another component only for loading async data\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction ShowModal({ itemId }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Modal open>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading ...</p>}>\r\n      {() => {\r\n        const item = ItemStorage.read(itemId);\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n          <Modal.Header>\r\n            <Modal.Title>{item.name}</Modal.Title>\r\n          </Modal.Header>\r\n          <Modal.Body>\r\n          { /* ... stuff with data of item ... */ }\r\n          </Modal.Body>\r\n        );\r\n      })\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </Modal>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrently this does not work because `children` is not allowed to be a function. So I have to define another component whos only task is to load the data and pass it to into the right place. I think there should be an easier solution, like the one used above. (To be honest, the code above works, **but** only because I use a wrapper component around the native React Suspense component.)\r\n\r\nMy currently wrapper component is defined like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction SuspenseRenderChildren({ children }) {\r\n  return children(); // really? :/\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Suspense({ children, ...props }) {\r\n  if (typeof children === "function") {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Suspense {...props}>\r\n        <SuspenseRenderChildren children={children} />\r\n      </React.Suspense>\r\n    );\r\n  } else {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Suspense {...props} children={children} />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTherefore I create some kind of *wrapper hell* because in the worst case I render the following ...\r\n```javascript\r\n<Suspense>\r\n  <React.Suspense>\r\n    <SuspenseRenderChildren />\r\n  </React.Suspense>\r\n</Suspense>\r\n```\r\n... where it could be just ...\r\n```javascript\r\n<React.Suspense />\r\n```',createdAt:"2019-02-22T23:12:21Z",author:{login:"MeiKatz",avatarUrl:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1072475?v=4"},assignees:{nodes:[]},url:"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14933",labels:{edges:[]}}},{node:{title:"Warnings when assigning to ref in render phase?",state:"OPEN",number:14935,body:"\x3c!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n--\x3e\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere are no warnings when assigning to `ref.current` in render phase.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nGiven that this mostly works now, but may cause issues on release of concurrent mode, it would be helpful to have a warning when assigning to a prop outside of `useEffect()`.\r\n\r\nE.g.

I think that it would be great to have a hook for enabling this capability. In other words: having the SCU functionality in functional components through a hook.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the existence of `React.memo` and I know that it is possible to accomplish the same thing by splitting the logic in 2 different functional components... as long as we enhance the \"base\" component with `React.memo`. However, I still think that the hook that I'm suggesting would be a pretty nice addition.\r\n\r\nI guess that it's a good idea to show an example of a real case where this hook would be helpful. So, here we go:\r\n\r\nI don't normally use the official react-redux bindings. Instead, I have my own version of the `connect` HOC which has a more limited (and slightly different) API, that better suits my needs. This makes my version a bit more performant and a lot lighter. Regardless of whether it is a good idea not to use the official react-redux bindings, the following example illustrates the benefit of having the hook that I'm suggesting.\r\n\r\nThis is the current implementation of my custom \"connect\" HOC:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst emptyObj = {};                                                           \r\nconst alwaysEmpty = () => emptyObj;                                            \r\n                                                                               \r\nexport default (fromStateProps_, fromActionProps = emptyObj, mapper) => {      \r\n  const dependsOnProps = fromStateProps_ && fromStateProps_.length !== 1;      \r\n  const fromStateProps = !fromStateProps_ ? alwaysEmpty : fromStateProps_;     \r\n                                                                               \r\n  return BaseComponent => {                                                    \r\n    const MBaseComponent = memo(BaseComponent);                                \r\n                                                                               \r\n    return props => {                                                          \r\n      const dependantProps = dependsOnProps ? props : emptyObj;                \r\n                                                                               \r\n      const {state, dispatch} = useContext(context);                           \r\n      const stateProps = useMemo(() => fromStateProps(state, dependantProps), [\r\n        state,                                                                 \r\n        dependantProps,                                                        \r\n      ]);                                                                      \r\n      const actionProps = useMemo(() => {                                      \r\n        const res = {};                                                        \r\n        Object.entries(fromActionProps).forEach(([name, aCreator]) => {        \r\n          res[name] = (...args) => dispatch(aCreator(...args));                \r\n        });                                                                    \r\n        return res;                                                            \r\n      }, [dispatch]);                                                          \r\n                                                                               \r\n      return useMemo(() => {                                                   \r\n        const finalProps = mapper                                              \r\n          ? mapper(stateProps, actionProps, props)                             \r\n          : {...props, ...stateProps, ...actionProps};                         \r\n        return <MBaseComponent {...finalProps} />;                             \r\n      }, [actionProps, props, stateProps]);                                    \r\n    };                                                                         \r\n  };                                                                           \r\n};                                                                             \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works great (for me).

Basically i am trying this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  commitUpdate(instance, updatePayload, type, oldProps, newProps, fiber) {\r\n    if (instance.isObject3D) {\r\n      applyProps(instance, newProps, oldProps)\r\n    } else {\r\n      // This is a data object, let\'s extract critical information about it\r\n      const parent = instance.__parent\r\n      const { args: argsNew = [], ...restNew } = newProps\r\n      const { args: argsOld = [], ...restOld } = oldProps\r\n      // If it has new props or arguments, then it needs to be re-instanciated\r\n      if (argsNew.some((value, index) => value !== argsOld[index])) {\r\n        // First it gets removed from its parent\r\n        removeChild(parent, instance)\r\n        // Next we create a new instance and append it again\r\n        const newInstance = createInstance(instance.type, newProps)\r\n        appendChild(parent, newInstance)\r\n        // Switch fiber node (???)\r\n        fiber.stateNode = newInstance // <---- this doesn\'t work\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a THREE data object which i am trying to map. Sometimes these objects cannot be mutated, THREE expects them to be re-created. One example of this is: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/PlaneGeometry \r\n\r\n> Any modification after instantiation does not change the geometry.\r\n\r\nI am creating the object in JSX like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<planeGeometry name="geometry" args={[width, height]} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the args change the instance has to be recreated, no other way around unfortunately.\r\n\r\nIt would be amazing if commitUpdate would be allowed to return an instance. And if it does the reconciler writes it into the fiber node. I am trying fiber.stateNode here, but it doesn\'t help. Next time commitUpdate is called it passes on the old instance again, which doesn\'t have a parent any longer.\r\n\r\nI don\'t really understand how these nodes work but the stacktrace says  \r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncommitWork(_current2, nextEffect)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere nextEffect ends up being "fiber" in the commitUpdate. "_current2" seems to be the one that still clings to the old stateNode.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

'Please enter a name' : undefined,\r\n    name: {\r\n      value: name,\r\n      onChange: e => setName(e.target.value),\r\n    },\r\n    email: {\r\n      value: email,\r\n      onChange: e => setEmail(e.target.value),\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis hook works fine when it is used inside a form component -- let's call it `<ContactForm>`. But say that your requirements change and you now need to be able to embed an arbitrary number of contacts in the form, and thus want to lift the state up into a `<ContactList>` component so that you can access all the contact state at once (see [demo](https://frontarm.com/demoboard/?id=e1a331f5-3468-488c-ab53-9eb455730af5)) -- there's no way to reuse the `useContactModel()` hook within `<ContactList>`, because it would need to be called within a loop.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction ContactList() {\r\n  let contactIds = ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\n  let contactModels = contactIds.map(useContactModel)\r\n\r\n  return contactIds.map((id, i) =>\r\n        <Contact\r\n          key={id}\r\n          model={contactModels[i]}\r\n        />\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe contact form example feels a little contrived, but this scenario of wanting to store some \"model\" an arbitrary number of times comes up relatively often when building forms. \r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nI've taken a cursory look at the source but I really don't understand it enough to know if this could even work, but with that said...\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to somehow assign keys to hooks, just as you can with components, and use that extra information to reconcile hooks called in conditionals/loops? For example, a hypothetical `withKey` function could accept a key and a callback, and allow for hooks to be called within the callback as if they were being called in a child component -- but returning the result of the callback instead of rendering elements.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet contactIds = ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\nlet contactModels = contactIds.map(id => \r\n  withKey(id, () => useContactModel())\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is possible or even particularly desirable given the potential performance problems of the enormous hooks it would enable.

I made a minimal project which can be used to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n1. Use Firefox\r\n2. The code must be executed in an extension\'s sandbox\r\n3. Reproducable only on several websites (one example is below)\r\n\r\nThe steps:\r\n1. Clone the repository https://github.com/karataev/firefox-addon-react-events-issue\r\n2. Open Firefox and type about:debugging in url\r\n3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"\r\n4. Open manifest.json in the src folder\r\n5. Navigate to the website https://www.ezibuy.com/shop/au/\r\n6. Open devtools, console\r\n7. Click with intervals on the CLICK ME window in the top left corner\r\n8. Notice that after some time "Click from React" stops logging, but "Click from addEventListener" logs all the time.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the screenshot.\r\n![firefox-react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12277086/53738427-bf439b80-3ec1-11e9-931b-462f8facc999.jpg)\r\n\r\nOn first clicks both "Click from React" and "Click from addEventListener" are being logged. After some time there are only "Click from addEventListener" left.\r\nI guess it happens because of some website\'s code being broken or something. But the extension\'s code is executed in a separate sandbox and it shouldn\'t affect React events behavior, right? Why React events handlers stops executing, but native events work as expected?\r\n\r\nOne last note: this bug is reproducable in the extension only. The repo contains direct-injection.js file with almost the same code which can be executed right in the devtools console. And the bug is gone.\r\n\r\nI\'ve spent half a day on this issue and I\'m frustrated.

My suspicion is that very few javascript engineers (and even fewer React developers) are familiar with DOM tree normalization, which results in many related issues being opened that are never attributed back to the decision whether React should work when the DOM tree is normalized.\r\n\r\nAt one point, an issue was submitted addressing the fact that React's own website breaks in Chrome: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12460 which is an issue that also links back to #11538.\r\n\r\n#11538 is an issue getting a lot of attention (based on the number of people who send me links to it, including engineering managers from Fortune 500 companies in connection with services we provide)\r\n\r\nThat ticket was closed with the final comment from @gaearon saying `Since there's nothing else that I can see actionable here, I'm closing this.`. \r\n@gaearon's final take on issue #9836 that originally addressed whether normalization is important to support was `\xaf\\(\u30c4)/\xaf`\r\n\r\nThe decision was clearly made haphazardly (and without the data we have now, that haphazard decision was likely appropriate back then.) But looking back at the issues that stemmed from that decision, I think it appropriate to reconsider this.\r\n\r\nIn issue #11538 @gaearon correctly raised the point that the problem might be related to issue #9836 (2nd comment down) that debated whether normalization should be supported.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9853 was opened in 2017 by @sebmarkbage to remove tests relating to DOM normalization. The description of that PR: `According to #9836 we're intentionally choosing to not support this until we have better proof of this being a big need. E.g. to protect against extensions. In a way that it's not better to push extensions to be fixed.`\r\n\r\nissue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538  was worthy enough to warrant the attention of Chromium developers, with React maintainers requesting that chromium *change the Chrome browser to accommodate React limitations* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=872770\r\n\r\nThat Chromium ticket may appear as though DOM normalization isn't related, but if you consider what would need to happen for that ticket to be resolved, DOM normalization becomes very relevant, if not necessary. See [Comment 9](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=872770#c9) and more directly relevant, [Comment 12](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=872770#c11).\r\n\r\nI could go on, but instead I'll include a list of tickets that (in 10 minutes time) I could find to be attributed to React's inability to function when the DOM is in a normalized state.

I was writing a component that used a few different pieces of state, but had some pieces which all needed to be set at more or less the same time, and as a response to an asynchronous action.\r\n\r\nI set both pieces of state, and when I went to test it the whole page crashed. It then took me several minutes of debugging to realize why not all of my state was set, despite my handler looking sound: the component was rerendered *during* the `setState` call.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

I've been working in react for two years and have never had a problem with class components and async code, for example.\r\n\r\nI'm also well aware of possible workarounds, like storing both fields in the same state object, or reordering the `setState`s such that the render doesn't switch to the new \"mode\" until the required state has been set. The first simple seems like it's non-idiomatic for hooks, and as for the second, one could imagine that it would become complicated once there are more modes, and the inter-dependencies between different pieces of state get messier.\r\nI could also use the unstable batched updates api, but I don't like the idea of depending on an unstable api, especially in code where I can't easily insulate myself from breaking changes in the api down the line.\r\n\r\nI'd just like to point out that this was what to me seemed like a very natural way to write the component, and that the crash caught me entirely by surprise.\r\n\r\nI know that it has been mentioned elsewhere that react may move to always batching `setState`s, and I think this gotcha may increase the impetus to go ahead and do so.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Every second, it sends a new message from the backend. The new message is meant to be appended to an array using `useState`. \r\n\r\nHere are a few different examples that highlight my confusion:\r\n\r\n**Example 1**\r\n[In this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/zz2lj8knyp), if I set the websocket's `onmessage` function once in `useEffect`, then whenever I call `setMessages` to update the `messages` array, the `messages` array I receive as an input is empty.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\r\n\r\nfunction receiveMsg(msg) {\r\n  setMessages(messages.concat(JSON.parse(msg.data)));\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseEffect(function() {\r\n    if (_.isUndefined(socket)) {\r\n      let ws = new MockWebsocket(\"ws://127.0.0.1:8080/\");\r\n      ws.onmessage = receiveMsg;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that I only ever get the latest message in my array.\r\n\r\n**Example 2**\r\nIf, however, I set the `onmessage` function on every render [as in this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/73kr25mkrj), then I get my full array with data appended as I would expect.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\r\n\r\nfunction receiveMsg(msg) {\r\n  setMessages(messages.concat(JSON.parse(msg.data)));\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (!_.isUndefined(socket)) {\r\n  socket.onmessage = receiveMsg;\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseEffect(function() {\r\n  if (_.isUndefined(socket)) {\r\n    let ws = new MockWebsocket(\"ws://127.0.0.1:8080/\");\r\n    ws.onmessage = receiveMsg;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `receiveMessage` function, my `messages` array is the whole array instead of an empty one in this example.\r\n\r\n**Example 3**\r\nBUT, if I assign a new reference to `messages`, [as in this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/j1n0py5zz3), and re-assign the value inside `receiveMsg`, then I don't have to re-assign the `onmessage` function over and over.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\r\nlet msgRef = messages;\r\n\r\nfunction receiveMsg(msg) {\r\n  msgRef = msgRef.concat(JSON.parse(msg.data));\r\n  setMessages(msgRef);\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseEffect(function() {\r\n  if (_.isUndefined(socket)) {\r\n    let ws = new MockWebsocket(\"ws://127.0.0.1:8080/\");\r\n    ws.onmessage = receiveMsg;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example 4**\r\nBut, if I assign a new reference and don't re-assign to it, [as in this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/8pkwr86p29), I continue ending up with an empty array. This suggests it's the assignment back to `msgRef` that is keeping the entire array within the closure.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\r\nlet msgRef = messages;\r\n\r\nfunction receiveMsg(msg) {\r\n  setMessages(msgRef.concat(JSON.parse(msg.data)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nMy original expectation was that example #1 would work. I can tell there's something I'm not totally understanding about the way the assignment of variables to closure works with this hook, but I'm struggling to define what exactly's going on. Can someone shed some light on why this works this way?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

The value `"Delete"` is incorrect as it is the decimal which is being pushed. But the decimal key is in fact the Delete key when the Num Lock is off... but it\'s weird that Chrome would understand that, but not IE, especially considering the key is producing the same `charCode` on both browsers.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that I am dealing with a "Synthetic Event" whose job it is to normalize the cross-browser differences.

It is also not a super big problem, as far as I see it. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to look into it, if this was confirmed as a bug, though :)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expected React to leave a white space between my text even if I break a line before an inline element (in my example a `<strong>`). In this case I would have to remove my line break for it to work. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate, this works fine:\r\n```\r\nexport default () => (\r\n  <p>\r\n    foo <strong>bar</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, when I checked in the console, I see the DOM created by React indeed trims out white spaces from the begining and the end of my string. The `nodeValue` for the `foo` text node in React is just that `nodeValue: "foo"` and in pureHTML it is `nodeValue: "\\n    foo\\n    "`.\r\n\r\nI should note that even if I add a space before the line break, it is still trimmed.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Because batching is a renderer/reconciliation-level concern, this API is exported by the renderer packages, not the core `react` package.\r\n\r\nThe React team has recently encouraged the Redux team to make use of `unstable_batchedUpdates` in React-Redux.  However, this becomes complicated due to how that API is being exported.\r\n\r\nIt\'s possible to deal with this at the bundler level.  Some experimentation shows that creating an alternate file with a `.native.js` extension will cause that to be picked up by the RN bundler, as in this example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// batch.js\r\nimport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from "./react-dom";\r\n\r\n// ./react-dom.js\r\nexport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from "react-dom"\r\n\r\n// ./react-dom.native.js\r\nexport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from "react-native"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not handle the case where an alternative React renderer is being used.  The [list of other React renderers is continuing to grow](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-react-renderer), which means that a React library that needs batching would have to deal with that situation in some way.  This becomes extremely complicated when you start considering variations on bundlers, module formats, and build environments.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely beneficial if the React core itself exported a `batchedUpdates` API.  That could default to being a noop wrapper like `(callback) => callback()` if no suitable implementation was available.\r\n\r\nI know that `unstable_batchedUpdates()` is, uh... "unstable".
